# These template files are pushed into the iptables directory
# The numbering system determines order of rules when imported into iptables
# Blacklist rules should be before whitelist rules
# Each server can have it's own set of rules, and should be added into the correct number group.
# Example: 250-pod-blacklist 350-pod-whitelist
